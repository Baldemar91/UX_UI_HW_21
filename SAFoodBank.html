                            SA Food Bank is a not-for-profit food bank that serves all of San Antonio, TX.  SA Food Banks goal is to alleviate hunger in San Antonio  by soliciting, collecting and packaging food for distribution through a network of service agencies and programs that serve their target population groups.

                            We need to dive deeper into why S.A. Food Bank users are not able to utilize the resources they need. We analyzed the current website to narrow down key factors and road blocks that would prevent users from accessing these resources.

                        <p>
                            To sympathize with our users we conducted six user interview and sent out a survey through social media. We obtained data that primarily focused on how users obtain their food.

                        We analyzed our user research and found that the current S.A. FoodBank website does not offer a translate option and their resources aren’t easily accessible. We prioritized user insights that were overly saturated during our interview processes.

                        We conducted in-person guerilla user testing to identify usability issues and roadblocks that create user frustrations. We found that our target audience would like a translate option and recognizable features to easily access the resources they need.

                            The latest design of S.A FoodBank alleviates user roadblocks with an English to Spanish toggle feature and highlights user accessibility options in brighter colors. We incorporated intuitive UI elements that are memorable and recognizable by current and new users. We wanted our users to acess the resrouces they need without having to click multiple times.

                            In order to immediately catch the attention of our users, we designed informative cards on the homepage with broad topics that would make it easier and more encouraging for users to get help, contribute and volunteer bridging both the organization and user needs. We also included a live video chat feature for both mobile and desktop websites to speak with an S.A. Food Bank representative and receive the assitance users need.

                            It was important that we made the food resource process more simple and efficient since our research revealed that many people lack the ability to access help. To address this barrier, we designed an English to Spanish toggle feature where users can click to toggle on the Spanish translate option. The idea behind redesigning the S.A. Food Bank website was to simplify user interactions by giving prominence to resources for people in need. We focused on features that can be easily recognized and can evolve over time depending on user needs.
